The logic error arises from a false premise about the nature of antibiotics, which are used to treat bacterial, not viral infections. This leads to a false cause because the assertion links the inefficacy of antibiotics with the viral nature of hepatitis A without establishing a valid cause-and-effect relationship."

This oversimplifies a complex relationship by equating their shared war experience with friendship, thus committing a false analogy. Additionally, it mistakenly implies that the mere fact they were both at the Somme causes the shift from wartime enemies to friends, which introduces a false cause fallacy. The phrase 'cast aside their wheelchairs' could also be an accident fallacy, as it mechanically applies a general rule about overcoming disabilities or limitations in a context that might not be relevant."
