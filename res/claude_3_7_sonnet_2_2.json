The statement also involves elements of false analogy by inappropriately extending the property of one component to an entirely different context (a complete vehicle structure). A vehicle needs a balance of different components with different properties to function properly - structural integrity, weight distribution, aerodynamics, etc. Simply multiplying one beneficial component wouldn't create a better whole system and would likely create a non-functional vehicle."

It incorrectly assumes that distributing 700 ml of water over 7 days is functionally equivalent to providing 700 ml all at once. Plants cannot store excess water for future use like a reservoir; they have specific absorption rates and needs. It also contains elements of False Analogy by comparing bulk watering to distributed watering as if they're equivalent processes for plant health, when they function differently biologically. The underlying False Premise is that plant health depends solely on total water volume rather than appropriate timing and absorption capabilities."

There's also Improper Distribution - it incorrectly adds up the daily recommended minutes into one session without considering the physiological differences.
