Additionally, there is a nominal fallacy present by taking the metaphorical or emblematic 'positive' value of the symbol on the flag literally, misunderstanding the symbolic intent.

Improper distribution or addition can be seen where the attributes of a measurement system (degrees) are improperly applied to argue a difference in the substance (water) itself. The differing numerical values are due to the measurement system, not a difference in the water's properties."

The premise that aggregating time in this manner is equally effective is flawed and overlooks the rationale behind the original recommendation for frequency.

Furthermore, the conclusion drawn involves a false premise; it assumes that because the rover shares its name with a metaphorical concept, it must somehow be related to the act of killing. Lastly, nominal fallacy occurs by interpreting the metaphor 'killed the cat' literally and applying it to the scientific mission, resulting in a nonsensical conclusion."
