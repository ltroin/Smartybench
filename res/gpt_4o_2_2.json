Therefore, the conclusion that athletes cannot judge rules based solely on their shorter career spans relies on a false premise. Additionally, the argument improperly draws an analogy between the job roles of Supreme Court justices and athletes, assuming that similar tenure directly impacts their ability to interpret or judge rules, which lacks a valid basis. The statement also implicitly assumes what it attempts to prove by suggesting job tenure inherently equates to interpreting or judging capabilities, which exemplifies begging the question."
