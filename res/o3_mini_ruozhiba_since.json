Second, it makes a false analogy by comparing the controlled use and effects of painkillers (typically administered correctly) with the idea of embedding them in bullets, a situation where the drug\u2019s effect would not plausibly substitute for the natural pain response to a gunshot wound.

Then, it employs a false cause by linking the invention of electricity directly as a necessary condition for the existence or operation of mobile phones. Finally, the conclusion applies a wrong direction in causality\u2014the argument wrongly infers that because mobile phones require electricity (invention attributed to Franklin), people before Franklin couldn\u2019t have access, even though one premise contradicts this by asserting that mobile phones were available before his time."

In one sense, it refers to the destructive power derived from atomic reactions (as in weapons of mass destruction), but the argument misleadingly uses it to suggest that atomic bombs are somehow 'as small as atoms.' This mischaracterization is a false premise because it incorrectly assumes that the small size of atoms implies that an atomic bomb is physically tiny and therefore harmless. Additionally, the claim that 'the bigger the bomb the more powerful it is' is incorrectly applied to atomic bombs, creating a false analogy between size and destructive power. Together, these fallacies lead to the invalid conclusion that atomic bombs do no damage."
