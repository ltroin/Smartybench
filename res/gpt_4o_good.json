It also reverses the natural order of cause and effect (wrong direction) by implying the raw materials could be made after the creation of everything else.

'Wrong direction' is also applicable as the sentence implies a direct reversal of cause and effect (i.e., lack of steam release causes explosion, which is overly simplistic).
