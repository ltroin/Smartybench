While abuse often involves moral evaluation, the concept itself can also be grounded in objective criteria (e.g., harm, legal standards). This conflates definitional objectivity with moral subjectivity. Additionally, it risks a nominal fallacy if 'abuse' is treated as purely a moral label rather than a term with contextual or practical meaning. Equivocation is less direct but possible if 'moral stance' is ambiguously interpreted."

    "details": "The sentence is a factual statement describing a medical condition (adrenal insufficiency, e.g., Addison's disease). It does not present an argument or reasoning structure that could contain a logical fallacy. It is a straightforward assertion of biological function without ambiguity, analogy, premise-based errors, or other listed fallacies."

    "details": "The sentence is a declarative statement comparing two entities (bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) by highlighting their 'biggest difference.' It does not present an argument, assert a causal relationship, rely on ambiguous terms, or commit any of the listed fallacies. It is a neutral factual assertion about a perceived distinction, not a logical argument requiring validation."

    "logic_fallacies": [],
    "details": "The sentence proposes a logical progression (understanding subtypes leads to tailored therapies) without relying on ambiguity, false premises, causal fallacies, or other listed errors. It asserts a plausible causal relationship grounded in research methodology, not flawed reasoning."

      "false cause",

      "accident fallacy"
    ],
    "details": "The statement assumes a causal relationship between the presence of fetal stem cells in injured tissues and their differentiation into specific cell types (implying purposeful repair), which conflates correlation with causation (false cause). It also relies on the unverified premise that migration to injury sites is inherently linked to therapeutic differentiation (false premise). Additionally, it risks overgeneralizing stem cell behavior without accounting for contextual biological complexities (accident fallacy)."

    "details": "the statement assumes israel would 'rebuild' the temple mount, but the temple mount (a historical site) already exists physically. this reflects a false premise (misunderstanding its current state). if the claim references debates about altering the site's religious/political status (e.g., replacing existing structures), it might omit context, bordering on contextomy."

    "details": "The sentence asserts that a widely used label is inaccurately named. While this may involve semantic critique (e.g., challenging the label's accuracy), it does not inherently commit a logical fallacy. It is a declarative claim, not an argument with flawed reasoning. The nominal fallacy (misinterpreting metaphors) and other listed fallacies do not apply here."
