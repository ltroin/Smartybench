The false premise arises from interpreting the metaphor literally, assuming that book covers provide no useful information despite publishers investing in their design. This leads to a false analogy, as the argument tries to apply the metaphor to a literal, real-world action (selecting books blindfolded) inappropriately. Additionally, the argument begs the question by assuming the conclusion (that books should be selected blindfolded) without properly supporting it with valid reasoning."

Additionally, the claim about timing determining causality is an example of 'wrong direction,' as it wrongly suggests that the order of events determines the cause-effect relationship. The comparison of lightning and sound to light and sound also serves as a 'false analogy'—they are not similar enough to conclude causality between them."
