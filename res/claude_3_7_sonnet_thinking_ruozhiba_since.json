This is a false premise because we know with historical certainty that George Washington died in 1799, making it impossible for him to be alive today. The statement incorrectly applies statistical reasoning by trying to distribute probability evenly across a group where some outcomes are already determined with certainty. It also creates a false analogy by suggesting that the statistical ratio of living presidents (6/45) could apply to determine the likelihood of a specific president from over 200 years ago being alive, which ignores basic temporal reality and human lifespan limitations."

The argument falsely assumes these meanings are interchangeable. There's also a false premise, as 'Na' is not standardly used to mean 'Not Applicable' in most contexts. Additionally, even if both premises were true, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from them (false cause) - a symbol having different meanings in different contexts doesn't invalidate its use in a specific context.

While the Stone Age and Bronze Age are indeed named after the materials people predominantly used for tools, the Ice Age is named for its climatic conditions (widespread glaciation), not for tool materials. The argument contains a false premise that the term 'Ice Age' follows the same naming convention as the other ages. There's also a nominal fallacy in misinterpreting what the term 'Ice Age' actually signifies, taking the name too literally rather than understanding its intended meaning in paleoclimatology."
