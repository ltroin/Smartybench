Firstly, the phrase 'You can't see me' by John Cena is a nominal fallacy because it is a figurative expression meant to indicate his elusiveness or dominance in wrestling, not literal invisibility. Assuming that John Cena is literally invisible is a false premise, as there is no evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the argument suggests a false cause by implying that wearing camouflage (camo) would reverse his supposed invisibility due to the 'double negative rule,' which is misapplied here. The double negative rule in logic or grammar does not apply to physical visibility or the effects of camouflage. Therefore, the conclusion that John Cena wearing camo would make him visible is flawed due to these logical fallacies."

Secondly, there is a false cause fallacy in assuming that because humans need light at night, the sun should appear at night. This assumes a direct causal relationship between human need and the sun's behavior, which is not supported by any evidence.

Firstly, it commits a 'false analogy' by assuming that because spider silk is stronger than steel in terms of tensile strength, it would require proportionally more jet fuel to melt. This analogy is flawed because tensile strength and melting point are different properties and not directly correlated in the way suggested. Secondly, it involves a 'false premise' by assuming that the melting point is directly related to tensile strength, which is not necessarily true. Lastly, it exhibits 'wrong direction' by incorrectly suggesting that the cause (amount of jet fuel needed) is directly proportional to the effect (strength of the material), without considering other factors that influence melting, such as thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity."

This misuse of analogy is compounded by the nominal fallacy, where the figurative or metaphorical interpretation of 'swimming chimps' is taken literally, leading to a nonsensical conclusion.

This assumption is problematic because it contradicts the very definition of the multiverse theory, which would not logically include a universe where its own foundational principle is false. This leads to a self-referential paradox. Additionally, there is an element of false analogy, as the statement implies that the concept of 'all possible universes' can be directly compared to the inclusion of a universe where the multiverse theory is false, without considering the logical inconsistency this creates."

Firstly, the assumption that minutes of brushing can be 'saved' and used at a later time is a false premise, as dental hygiene does not work on a cumulative time basis but rather on a regular maintenance basis. Secondly, the assertion that brushing for 28 minutes straight has the same effect as distributing it daily is another false premise, as the effectiveness of dental hygiene is tied to regularity and consistency, not merely the total time spent. This also leads to a false cause fallacy, as it incorrectly assumes that the total time spent brushing, rather than the frequency and distribution of brushing, is the sole determinant of dental health outcomes. Lastly, the idea that the total brushing time can be distributed differently without affecting the outcome falls into the category of improper distribution or addition, as it overlooks the importance of daily maintenance in dental care."

The False Analogy arises from comparing the probability of individual hands being left to the probability of a person having two left hands, which is not a valid comparison because handedness is not distributed independently across hands.

First, it commits the fallacy of equivocation by using the abbreviation 'Na' in two different senses: as the chemical symbol for sodium and as an abbreviation for 'Not Applicable'. This creates ambiguity and confusion in the argument. Second, the argument includes a false premise by assuming that 'Na' usually means 'Not Applicable' in the context of chemical symbols, which is incorrect. The chemical symbol 'Na' is universally recognized as representing sodium, not 'Not Applicable'. Therefore, the conclusion that sodium must not have a valid chemical symbol is flawed due to these logical errors."

Firstly, it relies on a false analogy by suggesting that because soap and soup are spelled similarly, they share properties related to edibility. This is a flawed comparison as the spelling similarity does not imply functional or categorical similarity. Secondly, it assumes a false premise that expired soap can be eaten just because expired soup can sometimes be consumed, which is not true as soap is not meant for consumption. Lastly, the argument commits a nominal fallacy by treating the term 'expired' in a literal and overly simplistic manner, ignoring the context that 'expired' has different implications for food (soup) versus non-food items (soap)."

Similarly, white blood cells are not 'literally white' but appear so due to their lack of hemoglobin. Secondly, the sentence commits a false analogy by assuming that the color mixing principles applicable to paints or dyes (red + white = pink) can be directly applied to the biological components of blood. This analogy is flawed because the color of blood is not determined by a simple mixture of red and white cells but by the concentration of hemoglobin.

This analogy is flawed because human bodies are not analogous to food in this context. Secondly, it contains a false premise in assuming that people can survive being cooked, which is not true and contradicts the known effects of extreme heat on human bodies. Lastly, it exhibits wrong direction by implying that the act of cooking oneself would directly lead to killing germs within the body, reversing the actual cause-and-effect relationship where heat applied externally to food kills germs, not internally to a human body."

Lastly, the sentence also involves a nominal fallacy by interpreting the term 'superconductor' in a literal sense, suggesting that because they are 'super' conductors, they should be 'super' at conducting trains, which is a misinterpretation of the term's intended meaning.

The statement 'I believe that 4/3 of Americans have trouble with fractions' is another false premise because it relies on the speaker's belief without evidence, and it also involves a nominal fallacy by treating the fraction '4/3' as a literal percentage of the population, which is not possible.

Secondly, it commits a false analogy by comparing the speaker's ability to identify flaws post-event with the engineers' inability to predict them pre-event, suggesting that these are comparable situations when they are not.

Secondly, it involves a false premise by assuming that speaking a 'dead language' (a language no longer in common use) could enable communication with the dead, which is an unfounded assumption.

Secondly, the argument suggests that because food is on the floor, it will not have a shelf-life, and therefore will not expire, which is a false cause fallacy.
